# Project Overview
I want to build a mac app the allows you to speak into the microphone and transcribe the audio in to text so that the user can do voice to text. The text will be inserted into the text input field of the application they are currently on.

## Platform
MacOS

## User stories
- as a user i want to be able to speak into the microphone of my computer and have that transcribed to text and then inserting it into the text field of the app that's currently opened
- as a user i want to be able to have that transcribed text into my clipboard if i need to paste it into other apps
- as a user need to see a pill that will animate as the voice is being recorded
- as a user i should be able to cancel out of the recording if i change my mind (keyboard shortcut)
- as a user i should be able to use keyboard shortcuts to trigger voice to text and to cancel if i change my mind
- as a user i should have the option to download the model locally to my computer so that it's focused on privacy. it should have a small, medium, large model (openai's whisper and whisper turbo models)
- as a user i want to be able to switch between local models i have downloaded in the settings screen
- user should be able to delete a model

# Requirements
- whisper models
- whisperkit

## Guidelines
- an mvp so we need to keep the scope small and tight
