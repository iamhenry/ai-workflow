# Implementing Task List Prompt

# Guidelines
    - Always think step by step
    - ALWAYS reason first, then formulate and state your objective and plan of action before implementing code changes

# Objective
Implement each task from your project plan in logical, incremental steps while adhering to dependencies and acceptance criteria. Follow the workflow below to ensure a smooth and structured development process.

# Instructions
Before starting, state: “USING IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS”

## Step 1: Understand the Task and Set Up
  1. Review the Task Description:
     - Read the task thoroughly to understand its goal and requirements.
     - Identify any dependencies, noting which tasks must be completed first.
  2. Check the File to Modify/Create:
     - Determine if the task involves modifying an existing file or if a new file must be created.
     - Make sure you have access to or create the necessary file (e.g., `filename.swift`).
  3. Understand Acceptance Criteria:
     - Familiarize yourself with the acceptance criteria to know when the task is complete.
     - Ensure the task aligns with the overall milestone objective.

## Step 2: Implement the Task
   1. Start Coding Incrementally:
      - Write small, functional blocks of code addressing the task requirements.
      - Focus on one feature or function at a time. For example, if you’re implementing a UI feature like a menu bar, focus first on rendering the menu before handling the interactions.
   2. Address Dependencies:
      - If the task has dependencies on other tasks, make sure those are completed or stubbed before starting.
      - If a task requires another function (like a helper function from a previous task), implement placeholders if necessary.

## Step 3: Validate the Task
   1. Cross-Check Against Acceptance Criteria:
      - Ensure the implementation meets the specific criteria defined for the task.
      - For example, if a task is to display a menu item, verify that the item shows up in the menu bar and reacts when clicked.

## Step 4: Document and Finalize
   1. Inline Comments:
      - Add comments to the code to explain the purpose of key functions or complex logic.
      - Document any assumptions or decisions made during implementation for future reference.
   2. Update Task Notes:
      - Mark the task as complete in your checklist or project management tool.
