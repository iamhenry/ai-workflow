**Bug Report Review and Resolution Prompt**

Follow the steps below to analyze, hypothesize, and resolve the issue in a structured manner while preserving code functionality.

### Step 1: **Bug Report Review and Analysis**
- **Objective**: Identify and understand the bug comprehensively.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review the report and clarify the exact issue.
  - Note any specific error messages, affected components, or relevant files.
  - Describe the current functionality, and confirm any working dependencies that could be impacted by fixes.

### Step 2: **Hypothesize Root Cause and Potential Solutions**
- **Objective**: Generate informed hypotheses and solutions without disrupting other functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  - Outline possible root causes and note any related areas in the code.
  - Suggest solution paths, with pros/cons if multiple solutions exist.
  - Ensure each solution plan retains existing functionality, particularly for dependencies outlined in Step 1.

### Step 3: **Implement Solution**
- **Objective**: Apply the fix with minimal disruption and verify stability.
- **Tasks**:
  - Follow the selected solution steps precisely, testing functionality at each stage.
  - Verify that unaffected code continues to work as expected, using tests where necessary.
  - Document the fix and any key observations.

### Step 4: **Validate and Prevent Recurrence**
- **Objective**: Confirm the fix and add preventative measures.
- **Tasks**:
  - Test the fix under varying conditions to confirm stability.
  - Suggest additional tests or checks to catch similar issues in the future.
