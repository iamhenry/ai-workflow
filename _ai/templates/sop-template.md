# Instructions
[Don't include this "Instructions" section in the generated SOP]
Generate a new .md file in the existing `ai/sop` dir, prefixed with "sop-[file-name]", containing a detailed comprehensive breakdown for the following sections:

# Goal
[Define the goal of the feature in detail]

# Acceptance Criteria
[Define the acceptance criteria]


# What It Should Not Do:
[Clearly specify any areas of the existing codebase that should remain unchanged. For example, if the feature should not modify existing components, logic, or routing structure, mention this to ensure no unnecessary changes are made. Outline any constraints such as avoiding changes to existing business logic, database schema where not needed, or bypassing performance-heavy operations.]


# Technical Requirements
[Expand into individual sections to ensure all areas are covered]

# Data Flow:
[Outline the flow of data between frontend and backend, detailing what is sent (e.g., form data, API requests), how it is processed on the server (e.g., validation, database interactions), and what is returned to the frontend (e.g., responses, data rendering). Include key interactions between components, API routes, and database queries.]

# Important Files:
[List the primary and secondary files that need to be created, modified, or referenced for this feature. Include inline comment describing the role of that file]

# Step-by-Step Implementation:
   * REQUIRED: Provide a numbered sequential checkbox list of detailed implementation steps
   * Keep the steps modular and easy to implement.
   * Ensure each step covers a specific, modular aspect of the feature (e.g., route creation, database schema update, server action implementation)
   * Include which file needs updating; If file doesnâ€™t exist then provide a suggestion
   * Include clear detailed instructions for integrating new code with existing code structure
   * Group related steps into logical sections (e.g., "Database Updates", "API Implementation", "UI Components")

[No code blocks in the final SOP]
